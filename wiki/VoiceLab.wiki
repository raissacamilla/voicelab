#summary About VoiceLab

VoiceLab intends to be an open source tool (or set of tools) for analysis of human singing, using existing open source libraries and new code for VoiceLab's specific needs.

If you'd like to join the research, (and later the coding), please contact us at: voicelabproject -AT- gmail.com .
